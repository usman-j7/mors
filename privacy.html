    <h1>MORS</h1>
    <p>Privacy Policy</p>
    <p>Last updated: [update this date]</p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      MORS Consulting Ltd ("MORS", "we", "us") is a consultancy focused on applied intelligence and private AI systems for regulated organisations.
      We are registered in England and Wales. This policy explains how we handle personal data in connection with our website and our services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What this policy covers</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visitors to <span>morsglobal.com</span></li>
      <li>People who contact us via the website form or by email</li>
      <li>Individuals whose details are processed in the course of our client work</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data we collect</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Website enquiries</h3>
    <p>
      When you submit the contact form, we collect the details you provide, such as:
      name, work email, role, organisation, region, team size, and a short description of your use case.
    </p>
    <p>We use this information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respond to your enquiry</li>
      <li>Assess whether and how we can work together</li>
      <li>Maintain records of potential and current engagements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Client engagements</h3>
    <p>
      When working with clients, we may process limited contact details of client personnel and access certain datasets or environments strictly for the purposes
      defined in the engagement documents (e.g. NDA, statement of work, data processing addendum).
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use client data to train shared models or for unrelated purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Technical information</h3>
    <p>
      Our website may collect basic technical information (such as IP address, browser type, and pages visited) for security, reliability, and usage understanding.
      If we use analytics, they are configured to avoid unnecessary tracking and to minimise personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Legal bases (UK / EU GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We process personal data on the following bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to operate our business, respond to enquiries, and improve our services.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to perform our obligations under NDAs, proposals, and engagement letters.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where required for specific optional activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. How we share data</h2>
    <p>We may share personal data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers who help us host the website, manage forms, or deliver services (under appropriate agreements)</li>
      <li>Professional advisers (legal, accounting) where needed</li>
      <li>Authorities, where required by law or to protect our rights or those of others</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal data. We do not grant third parties rights to use client data for their own model training.
    </p>

    <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Where data is transferred outside the UK or EEA, we aim to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent protections.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep enquiry records and engagement-related data only for as long as needed for the purposes described above, or as required by law and professional obligations.
      Client-specific retention is usually set out in the engagement terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use technical and organisational measures appropriate to the nature of the data and the risks involved, including restricted access, encryption where appropriate,
      and isolation of client environments. No system is perfectly secure, but we design our work assuming confidentiality is critical.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the use of your personal data, and to object to certain processing.
      You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.
    </p>
